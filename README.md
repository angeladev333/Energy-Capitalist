# Energy-Capitalist
Energy Capitalist is a free to play incremental web-based game promoting environmental sustainability through using smart devices in a household. 
The goal is to conserve as much energy you can by turning off devices and purchasing all the smart devices in the web shop. 
The in-game items are based on smart Google devices, and you can earn currency based on the decisions you make and the items you purchase. 
The currency represents the total energy saved in the household, and it puts into perspective how much energy can be saved from using automated technologies.

This project was created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and the Bulma framework.
